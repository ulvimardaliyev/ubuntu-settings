Mouse scroll setting

Install imwheel and adjust (to make things work):
Run sudo apt install imwheel
Run bash <(curl -s http://www.nicknorton.net/mousewheel.sh)
Using the slider adjust the scroll speed 'multiplier'. (I like it on 4/5)
Add imwheel as a startup application (to make things continue working after restart):
Open Apps -> Startup Applications
Add a new entry to the bottom of the list: Name= Wheel Scroll Speed, Command= imwheel, Comment= Activates wheel scroll speed fix on system startup (or whatever you like)
